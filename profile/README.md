# Encoteki

Encoteki is an innovative project dedicated to creating a self-sustainable environment and community through the power of technology and NFTs. Our mission is to conserve endangered animals in Indonesia, support local communities, and offer tangible benefits to our project participants.

At the core of Encoteki is the belief that everyone can make a positive impact on the environment and community. By leveraging Bitfinity and ICP blockchain technology, Encoteki not only ensures transparency and accountability in every action but also provides NFT holders with unique utilities, including access to special events, discounts, and potential profit-sharing opportunities through our subsidiaries.

Join us in making a meaningful difference while enjoying the benefits of being part of a forward-thinking ecosystem. Let's create a better world together, one NFT at a time.
